# Data-Cleaning-and-Restructuring-in-R
This project involves reading in data, cleaning data, reordering data, merging data, and restructuring data 

Cleaning data involves identifying and addressing any issues or inconsistencies in the dataset. This includes handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers. By cleaning the data, we ensure its quality and reliability for subsequent analysis.

Reordering data involves rearranging the columns or variables within a dataset. This can be useful when you want to prioritize certain variables, improve readability, or align the data with a specific structure or format.

Merging data involves combining multiple datasets based on common columns or variables. This operation allows you to bring together related data from different sources and create a unified dataset for analysis. Merging is often used to enrich datasets or combine information from different perspectives.

Restructuring data refers to transforming its shape or structure to suit specific analytical requirements.Restructuring data is valuable for reshaping the data to meet the needs of different analyses or visualizations.
